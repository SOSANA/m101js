To check whether you have added the right index on the posts collection, run
	cd validate
	npm install
	node hw4-3_validate.js
You don't need to have the blog running for validate to succeed.
You might want to look at the blog code to see what queries it does to the posts collection. they need to be fast.
Need to import posts.json.
