 Homework: Homework 2.3

Blog User Sign-up and Login

If you have not already done so download the homework files for this week.

You should see four files at the highest level: app.js, users.js, posts.js and sessions.js. There is also a views directory which contains the templates for the project and a routes directory which contains our express routes.

If everything is working properly, you should be able to start the blog by typing:

npm install
node app.js

Note that this requires Node.js to be correctly installed on your computer. After you run the blog, you should see the message:

Express server listening on port 3000

If you goto http://localhost:3000 you should see the front page of the blog. Here are some URLs that must work when you are done.

http://localhost:3000/signup
http://localhost:3000/login
http://localhost:3000/logout

When you login or sign-up, the blog will redirect to http://localhost:3000/welcome and that must work properly, welcoming the user by username.

We have removed parts of the code that uses the Node.js driver to query MongoDB from users.js and marked the area where you need to work with "TODO: hw2.3". You should not need to touch any other code. The database calls that you are going to add will add a new user upon sign-up and validate a login by retrieving the right user document.

The blog stores its data in the blog database in two collections, users and sessions. Here are two example docs for a username ‘sverch’ with password ‘salty’. You can insert these if you like, but you don’t need to.

> use blog
switched to db blog
> db.users.find()
{ "_id" : "sverch", "password" : "$2a$10$wl4bNB/5CqwWx4bB66PoQ.lmYvxUHigM1ehljyWQBupen3uCcldoW" }
> db.sessions.find()
{ "username" : "sverch", "_id" : "8d25917b27e4dc170d32491c6247aabba7598533" }
>

Once you have the the project working, the following steps should work:

    go to http://localhost:3000/signup
    create a user

It should redirect you to the welcome page and say: welcome username, where username is the user you signed up with. Now:

    Goto http://localhost:3000/logout
    Now login http://localhost:3000/login

Ok, now it’s time to validate you got it all working.

You can validate the blog using the validation script we've provided in the 'validate' directory. Just run the following commands:

cd validate
npm install
node validate.js

For those who are using MongoHQ, MongoLab or want to run the webserver on a different host or port, there are some options to the validation script that can be exposed by running:

node validate.js --help

If you got it right, it will provide a validation code for you to enter into the box below. Enter just the code, no spaces. Note that your blog must be running when you run the validator.
